## the Civilian's Complex routine, an exercise in armchair centrism

The tacit understanding of the needs and concerns of middle-class comfort.

As do poets create monsters at will, a person can create an idea. However, despite such endeavors, the limitation of time is always present.

And thus begins the need of self-propagation and infinitive-basis, a utopian watchmaker's workshop

To understand the limitation of time, first consider that of the tortoise and hare, one moves slow and reflective, the other fast from one place to another.

Ancient Greece held two distinct principles for time, that of Chronos and Kairos.

Chronos refers to numeric, or chronological, time as a quantitative force.

Kairos refers to, literally "the right or opportune moment", used to metaphysical or Divine time, a qualitative force.

And lastly, time can be further expanded to include the Roman deity Janus, double faced looking both at the future and past at once.

Taken at once time itself becomes a steady stream to which we are given "drops of time", and it is now that we can observe the basic structure of things without being overwhelmed by the details.

## personal tactician

cards, built-in scenarios/battle

train to avoid pitfalls by challenging your instincts and training them with constructive plans.

It involves the use of cards, a classic representation of our struggles.

spade of swords, heart of cups, diamond of pentacles, club of wands
jack the valet, Bube, Unter, Page, fante (instruments, one eye for hearts/spades)
queen the Dame, Konigin, regina (flowers, sceptre for for spades)
king the roi, Konig, re (swords, ax for diamonds)
knight the chevalier, Ober, Ritter, cavall, cavliere
joker of red, black, white

Each suit represents on of the quadrants:

#### A need of self-propagation and infinitive-basis, a utopian watchmaker's workshop

Also take (**Huff Parker**) Damn, he muttered checking the time. He was running late and had already forgotten anything memorable from his dreams. The thoughts of work were encroaching upon his mind. Damn, he said again. And so it was. Lying in bed in a messy bedroom, unshowered/unshaved stash of drugs, smoking with Mr. Pibbles.

Here we have the cave of darkness (clan of cats) suffering the prisoner's dilemna to the light outside. "worker" dirty habits vs. "king" technology scenario

- ("overinflated bloat") madness, confusion, details, so many goddamn details, scattered thoughts like papers, try to grab as many as you can, random universe, forget something and go back to get it, you're going off course into dead time where you see things you normally wouldn't, things as they are without you there
- ("pure primalcy") Need to defeat my colossi, catch the millennium to save myself, past/present/true/false matrix as lie detectorHence. dark tower as mountain top? something to waste away on, the "kings" I pay homage to... 

### State and Process in Non-Death Scenario (Current State)
      
Laws of Governance [order]: past/present/true/false

- Self, people, ability to empower [spec] - "power"
- Task, item, supply, transport [build] - "raid" (good to get lost)
- Cash, papers, home/market, utility/subsidy [resource] - "establishment"
- Desert mentality, sustainable boat cabin [relic] - "world citizenship"

Choice comes down to power (making plans), raid (expand territory) vs. establishment (build a core) and "world citizen" (consumption).

### the remarkable routine to maximize the quandrant

1. awake to noise/music/news with natural light in a cozy den, change clothes and do chores (household order, diner) for exercise, have coffee and movable snack, equip lead lighter "metal" gear and pack bag with supplies
1. take a shower in the hot springs with hygiene, dress/style in clean linens with an agenda, maps and charts, track charts/reports/graphs/quadrants, research or write/call people, prioritize, clean as you go, map (unfamiliar) territory with projects laid out as paths, chart a course/campaign through day-to-day activities/battles with feats/losses, script your day with storyboard tasks/events/deliverables/objectives...
1. open shop, discuss specifications (we'll eat first, then go), commute by drive or passenger, make observations on the environment, every now and then go to grocery for food, errands/stocks/shipments
1. meeting must not be fun, but business, adversaries and islands (with whales) with evil bankers, two shelters in position, both shaky, we'll raid them and take fire, fun and games said the officer, we saw your smoke, what have you been doing? having a war or something? on friendship, let's have a fort, people haul rocks up a mountain, each move on in a different way
1. get home and sit on floor with back against wall, take shower, do laundry, spend time with friends, eat dinner, watch old shows with chess/cards, relax, sit and read by a fire, work late with classical music, study with homework/reading/writing/drawing, climb/dive/fly
1. rest and wash up, drink water, easy medication, medicine, then sleep (if stressed, midnight snack of milk and apple)


1. climb/dive/fly, be Mr. Happy and own a mountain, beach "model" island sanctuary in sustainable [boat](https://www.boattrader.com/boat/2005-catamaran-cruisers-35-vagabond-7311908/) cabin with hawks/whales in Edmonds with bio toilet as a isolationist outpost, coast with Canada and Mexico by 41, expeditions for artifacts/relics, nomad/forager, maps/charts for geocaching/geotagging, freedom to roam, Silver dollars, victory gin

### Case example: Huff Parker (asleep)

Suffering from the prisoner's dilemna, a person is alone and confused now fallen into a state of continual discomfort. For example, he wakes up in a cave of darkness. Damn, he mutters checking the time. He was running late and was already lost in the memories of last night's dream. The thoughts of work encroach upon his mind and for a moment he tells himself one more minute of rest until his phone awakens. Damn, he said again and so it was. Lying in a messy bedroom, unshowered/unshaved, only looking forward to his stash of drugs and a smoke with Mr. Pibbles and his clan of cats, now oblvious to the light outside.
